Java Compiler or Interpreter? 

Answer:
java uses both compiler as well as interpreter.

java code converts into byte code through compiler than interpreture converts this byte code into machine language code. 

JIT also used in place of interpreter makes program execution fast it also converts byte code into machine code.
